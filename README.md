# eWallet

## Problem Statement

eWallet is a web based wallet system that helps manage finances conveniently and digitally from one centralized system.

<br/>User should be able to:
* Register, login and manage their profile.
* Deposit money into the wallet or withdraw money away from  eWallet.
* View his/her current balance and income & expense by month in the dashboard
* Purchase a product, provided by a merchant, directly from eWallet (To make it convenient for user as they can purchase a product directly from eWallet)
* Receive notification when a payment is made or received.
* View the transaction logs.

<br/>Merchant should be able to:
* Create a product that the user will buy directly from the eWallet
* View earnings made from a product
* Receive notification when payment is received
* Withdraw money away from eWallet

<br/>There needs to be a category in the system where merchants add their products.

There must be a role based authorization for users and merchants so that users cannot access URIs restricted for merchants and vice versa
